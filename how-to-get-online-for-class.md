# How to login to class

Our classes are scheduled take place on Mondays and Wednesdays from 11h30 until 13h00. We are expecting that the class will be fully synchronous \(i.e. we meet online during scheduled class times\). 

 It is key that you get [Teams](syllabus/digital-tools/ms-teams/) and [Perusall](syllabus/digital-tools/perusall/) working as soon as possible. Perusall is easy to get working. Teams, if you haven't used it before at Carleton, may not be. So please try to login before class starts in September.

We will meet on Teams for our first class at 11h30 on **Wednesday, September 8th, 2021**. In preparation for using Teams for videoconferencing, please follow the steps outlined below.

Having helped students and colleagues try to use Teams last year, I know that it can be either easy to login or quite frustrating. The ratio seems to be about 50/50. So please do not leave it to just before class to try to get it running!

1. Figure out your Carleton email, either by activating it for the first time or ensuring that you are able to use it.
2. â€‹Install [Teams](syllabus/digital-tools/ms-teams/) on your computer and set it up. If at all possible don't use the browser version.
3. Make sure you are part of the "MEMS2001" Team.
4. If our Team doesn't pop up as an option in your Teams dashboard, click on the "Join or Create a Team" button and enter the code: **02dygd8.** This will only work if you are correctly logged in to Teams with your Carleton account.
5. Find the general channel and text everyone "hello" and introduce yourself to tell us you're successfully logged in.
