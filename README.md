# MEMS 2001 \(Fall 2021\)

Welcome to the static course site in support of Carleton University's MEMS 2001, _Discovering the Medieval and Early Modern Past_ taught by Dr. Marc Saurette. In class, we'll mostly be talking about the Middle Ages \(and less the early modern part\), a time John Milton called, "a dreary tale of battles between kites and crows". Frankly, others have said worse, but we still take umbrage at such a characterization. By the end of this course hopefully we'll have dispelled the negative associations linked to the time period and made you more aware of its unique beauty and problems.

The class focusses on dispelling myths of the Middle Ages and on trying to get you to see the time period with new eyes. Our focus will be thematic, not chronological \([HIST 2000](https://carleton.ca/history/undergraduate/courses/2000-level-3/hist-2000a/), however, does teach the Middle Ages in a more chronological fashion\). We will address both the history of the discipline \(e.g. why do universities think its important to teach about the medieval world\), popular representations of the time in books, film and games, as well as introduce students to the fundamentals of researching the Middle Ages. 

In the Fall of 2021, we'll be teaching this course online due to the still glowing embers of a worldwide pandemic. We'll be using MS Teams as our information/ teaching platform and using Perusall for readings. Both take a bit of work to get used to, so I have provided how-to guides. We are going to spend our scheduled class time online together â€“ discussing readings, sharing thoughts and \(hopefully!\) getting to know one another.
