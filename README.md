Welcome to the course github for MEMS 2001, Discovering the Medieval and Early Modern Past. Mostly we'll be talking about the Middle Ages, a time John Milton called, "a dreary tale of battles between kites and crows". Frankly, others have said worse, but we still take umbrage at such a characterization.

 By the end of this course hopefully we'll have dispelled the negative associations linked to the time period and made you more aware of its unique beauty and problems.
