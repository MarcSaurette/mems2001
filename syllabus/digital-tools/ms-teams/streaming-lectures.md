# Streaming Lectures

Something we might experiment with is recording the lectures, warts and all. If this is something that interests you, the lectures will be available via MS Stream.

To make it easy to find, I'll have a tab in the general channel called "recordings" that links to any recorded lectures. 

Also, you could look for the videos in the following \(more difficult\) way.

1. Open up MS Teams
2. Find the leftmost sidebar, and click on the elipsis \(...\) on the bottom.

Stream is the icon with the red arrow on it.

3. Click on Stream and a window of class recordings should pop up.

Well, it actually doesn't have anything yet since class hasn't started...

4. Enjoy the Greatest Hits presented there on your own time...
