# Quick Guide to cuPortfolio

## Here is a rough guide to getting started with cuPortfolio:

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not create a Group Page or a Group Collection. This means that anyone in the group (i.e. the MEMS 2001 class) can edit the page.
{% endhint %}

1. Use your username (firstnamelastname) and password to login

2\. Click on one of the many tabs to see "My Groups" and click on "MEMS2001 in the sidebar. (ITS has not yet created the MEMS 2021 course for me yet, so the images will be taken from an existing course, but you'll get the idea).&#x20;

When you login it will look something like this. Might be different if on a phone.

3\. When you enter the class "Group" it will look something like this:

4\. Scroll down the page and locate "Shared Collections". Find the Collection names "Your Name Here's Portfolio" and click on it. Make sure the one you are clicking on is authored by me (Marc Saurette) not anyone else who copied the collection but forgot to rename it.

5\. When you open the collection, it will looks something like the following. Find the elipsis (...) on the upper right corner of the page and press it, then click on "Copy".

6\. You will be asked to copy page or collection. CHOOSE COLLECTION!

![](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-M4yKpPlPdQosdDQEEYo%2F-MExBl9jFZU1by\_kBkwg%2F-MExGfabHhVKiCKmv9OY%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-08-17%20at%2012.20.52%20PM.png?alt=media\&token=c9074598-a705-4f78-bc73-f7da48492e3f)

{% hint style="info" %}
Superduper important to choose "Collection".
{% endhint %}

7\. You will be prompted to rename it. Make sure you rename it something like "Your Name's Portfolio...".

![](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-M4yKpPlPdQosdDQEEYo%2F-MExBl9jFZU1by\_kBkwg%2F-MExHAysyt-w0FceZKnr%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-08-17%20at%2012.21.18%20PM.png?alt=media\&token=901a7054-f155-4066-a26f-f7879d36e9d7)

Please please please change the name...

8\. You will be taken to the next page which will allow you to add pages to the collection. Don't do that at this point. Just scroll to the bottom of the page, confirm that there are the "Pages Already in the Collection" as in the following image and then press "Done".

You're almost done.

9\. You now need to share you collection with the group (MEMS2001A). When you complete copying the collection or if you come back and edit the collection later, you can change sharing by clicking on "Share" in the upper left corner of an open page.

Click share!

10\. Make sure the collection is shared with the whole class. Don't worry about "Advanced Share Options" just scroll to the bottom of the page, click on the "Share With" drop-down menu and find our class (MEMS2001 Fall 2021) and allow "Everyone in the Group" to view it.

Press "Save" and you're done!

11\. Rejoice! You're done! Actually, now you should start working on your Profile.
