# Assessment

As students, you are probably used to being categorized by your grades. Maybe you have been taught to be so focused on grades that it is one of your key identities \(e.g. "I am an A-student\). I \(Marc\) certainly was. I felt academic competition was so central to who I was, that I never got out of the academic track and couldn't see myself outside of it - and thus ended up as your professor. It might have driven me, but learning doesn't necessarily happen best in this system. 

Grades weren't widely used in universities and public education until the 1940s. This might seem like a long time, until you realize that so-called universities have been around for more than 800 years. Instead, I want your learning to primarily to be focussed on, well, learning, not on earning the intangible academic currency called grades. The competition inherent to "earning grades" often leads to poor academic practices among studentsâ€“ hoarding knowledge so that others can't access it, unwillingness to be collegial, and disdain for working together in case a slacker brings down your mark. I want us to work together, share ideas and practice being Historians/ Medievalists in public without fear of failure \(failure can actually be a really good way to learn\). So in the first term we are going to practice "ungrading".

And just because I don't care about grades doesn't mean that I don't care about how you are doing. By us being online, I will have more hard data on the work you are all doing than for most other class I have taught before. Thanks to our digital interfaces, I can't help but notice whether you are "in class" or not or whether you have done the reading on Perusall or not. I really care about you doing the work and gaining the learning that happens as a result.

If you want to read a bit more about the idea of ungrading and how it can work in classrooms see the [work by Jesse Stommel](https://www.jessestommel.com/how-to-ungrade/) or take a look at this post by [Jessica Zeller](https://www.jessicazeller.net/blog/pedagogy-for-end-times).

While I don't really believe in grades, other professors and, well, the university do. So it is perhaps ultimately necessary for you to get one. I want all of you to succeed in this course and it would make me very happy to be able to give all of you an A.  I just need you to give me a good reason to do so.  

The first term of the course offers you space to experiment. For the most part, I will read and comment on your written work, and give you feedback via [Hypothes.is](../digital-tools/hypothes.is.md), but I won't give it a grade. Some feedback may be publicly accessible to everyone in class. You will be given advice on how to improve and better your work. You will regularly rate yourself for participation and twice in the term you will produce a "process letter" which makes an argument for what grade you should receive. Your process letter must take into account your classwork, participation , your annotation record.
