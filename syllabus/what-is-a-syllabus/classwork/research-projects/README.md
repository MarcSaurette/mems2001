# Research Project

Each student will complete a research project over the course of the term. It will consist of 

1. Choosing a topic from a [list of potential topics](../research-topics.md)
2. Finding some scholarly sources to help understand and describe the topic to others. [Your goal will be to cite them properly](annotated-bibliography.md) and provide a few sentences describing and categorizing them. 
3. You will write up a detailed report highlighting X and Y.
