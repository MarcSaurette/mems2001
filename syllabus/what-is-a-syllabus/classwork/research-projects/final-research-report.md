# Final Research Report

Your final research report will not only outline a topic but also find and introduce a primary source \(text extract, piece of art etc.\) which could be used by a student to understand the topic.

Your final research report will consist of two parts

1. the student offers a a critical introduction to a topic
2. the student presents a primary source \(or extract from a primary source\) that could be used to understand their topic. 

#### Critical Introduction

This section is a corrected and expanded version of the [preliminary report](preliminary-report.md), which lays out a general introduction to the historical topic. It should:

1. be able to summarize the general outline of the chosen topic, describing what it was, when and where it happened, who was involved
2. be able to talk about how historians have debated it. You should be able to mention at least one way \(methodology\) how the topic has been studied
3. highlight the significance of the topic. Students should be able to say why the topic or the way it has been interpreted is important or has relevence. 

#### Primary Source

The general account of the topic acts as a sort of introduction to this second part. Here, you should find and present a primary source \(this can be an extract of a large written work, a short work in its entirety, an architectural plan, an image of decoration, material culture, art work etc. \). This primary source, however, cannot simply be plunked down without contextualization, but rather needs to be introduced with key information \(author/artist, name, time of creation, where created\) and a brief summary arguing how the primary source relates to how the topic has been studied and its significance \(no. 2 & 3 of part I\). 

Then, the report must reproduce an image or text of the primary source. 

#### Bibliography

The final component of the research project is attaching your previously completed annotated bibliography, augmented or altered if your thinking has changed or you have read additional scholarly sources. 

#### Assessment

This assignment will be the single piece of written work to receive a grade from the professor. Grading will consider timeliness of completion; scholarliness of sources; fulfillment of length and image requirements; accuracy and fullness of acknowledgement of sources; effort to answer all relevant questions posed in assignment; quality and thoughtfulness of answers presented; accuracy of information presented; clarity and correctness of communication; effectiveness of organization; creativity and/or concern for ease of end-reader interface and understanding in CUPortfolio.
