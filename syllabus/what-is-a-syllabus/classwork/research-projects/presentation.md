# Presentation

A presentation of basic information about your medieval/early modern topic as part of a small group timeline presentation. You will be responsible for the portion of the presentation showcasing your topic and will be assessed both on that individual portion and on the overall clarity, cohesiveness and effectiveness of the group’s presentation.

**Length** : 15 minutes per group

*  Groups can choose to present live in class i nour synchronous Teams meetings OR
* can record/edit your group presentation and upload to Teams/ MS Streams for us OR
* do a group PowerPoint with recorded comments for each slide for the class to watch

**Content**: You need to introduce the class to your group’s 3-5 topics. Present the key basic information on the topics \(what, when, where\) as well as whatever you and your group have determined is most significant or interesting for the class to know about the topics. You are expected to integrate all the group’s topics into a timeline and a map so that the class can start constructing a mental overview of the 500-1700 CE period. In other words, some sort of visual display of the chronological order and overlap of the 3-5 topics presented and some sort of map/geographical positioning of the topics are expected as you teach the class about these topics and their cultural and historical import.

\(Re: making a timeline: You can try this tool to a make a timeline app: [http://timeline.knightlab.com/](http://timeline.knightlab.com/); or develop your own timeline slide on PowerPoint or some other format; or take a photo of a timeline your group has co-designed and had someone in the group draw up during your meetings!\)

Your work will be evaluated based on your personal performance in your 2-3 minute section of the presentation \(Do you speak audibly and clearly? Do you have accurate researched information to present? How well organized is your section? Do you stick to your time limit?\). In addition, there general group performance will be assessed - based on: clarity and accuracy of timeline and map \(do you handle complex overlaps and time spans effectively?\); organization of group’s communication; creativity of group’s communication of timeline and map; effectiveness of group’s teaching; group’s acumen in discerning what is important/key to present re: 3-4 topics; group’s ability to stick to time limit; group’s ability to answer any questions posed and to engage class
