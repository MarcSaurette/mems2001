# Preliminary Report

This will be a draft report on your initial research findings about your chosen [research topic](../research-topics.md). Present what information you have so far regarding the following assigned questions for the final assignment \(which is longer\).

{% hint style="info" %}
This is your preliminary report on your findings—try to answer SOME of these questions; you don’t need to answer them all for this draft \(and you won’t have space to do so in 400-500 words\), but you will need to answer these questions for the final report.
{% endhint %}

* When did your person/group/thing/event exist or happen in the Common Era? \(specify beginnings and endings\)
* What happened? \(discern key events\) or What is it? \(describe clearly\)
* What did the individual do in his/her life? \(discern key events\) or What did the group do? \(discern key events\) or What does the artwork narrate or depict? \(broad strokes if is very long or complex\) or What was the object/building used for?
* Where is the artwork or text or building found today? \(manuscripts?, location?\) 
* What sources from its/their period tell us about the artwork/ group/ person/ event?
* What was going on around the time of the event/ artwork’s composition or copying? What were the larger events or trends shaping the culture whence your topic emerges or against which it takes shape? \(discern what seems key or most interesting to you\)
* Why does the person/group/thing/event matter? \(be specific\) Why should we know about him/her/them/it today? Why should it/him/her/them be included in a survey of the 500-1700 CE period?
* In what ways does your topic help us sense the alterity \(difference and strangeness\) and the complexity of the past? \(which is, according to Bull, the reason to study it\)
