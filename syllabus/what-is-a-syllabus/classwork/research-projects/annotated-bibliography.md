# Annotated Bibliography

An annotated bibliography is a research tool meant to offer concise, critical commentary on sources you have read on a topic. It is meant to provide an _aide memoire_ when working on a large research project. These days researchers often keep track of reading and research using citiation software \(such as Zotero\) or spreadsheets, but we are going old fashioned text based!

You bibliography exhibits your research skills and your ability to find and understand _scholarly_ sources. Therefore, the works you cite and describe should be found by following the research steps spoken about in class \(October 4th and 6th\) and learned by doing the [Library Research Hunt](../../../../modules/exercises/library-research-hunt.md). While wikipedia is a good starting point for research \(to orient you to basic information\), it cannot count as a scholarly source for the purposes of this assignment.  

Your annotated bibliography must include at least one of each of the following:

1.  encyclopedia/dictionary entry on your research topic
2.  book length study of the topic \(a monograph\)
3.  scholarly article. 
4. primary source that could be used to understand the topic
