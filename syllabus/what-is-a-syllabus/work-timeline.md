# Key Dates

{% hint style="info" %}
In addition to the written work outlined below, students must complete their readings and making their comments/annotations to the assigned readings by Saturday 10pm before the school week begins. 

For example, the readings for week 3 \(September 20th and 22nd\) must be completed at the end of week 2 \(by 10pm, September 18th\). This is so that I have a chance to read through your annotations before class and respond to your questions/ ideas â€“ thereby allowing us to draw the readings more easily into our class discussions.
