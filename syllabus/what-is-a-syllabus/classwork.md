The bulk of your work this term will be reading. You need to read, both the learn how medievalists write, but also to practice your ability to read carefully, closely and critically.

I am trying something new this year. Instead of having the bookstore order physical books to campus \(which I am not sure if you are going to be nearby\), we will instead use digital books which we will read and annotate together via Perusall.  Perusall allows for [social annotation](http://www.grandviewcetl.org/tools-for-teaching-social-annotation/) which will be a key part of our learning experience this year. 

You will not need to purchase any textbooks for this class. 

### What is Social Annotation?

Social annotation takes the usually solitary act of reading and allows students to do it in community with one another. By using digital tools to highlight, comment, or otherwise annotate a text, students “do the reading,” but do so in conversation with their peers.

We are going to experiment with the QQTPA method for class.  When you are reading on Perusall/ with Hypothes.is in preparation for class, you are asked to highlight key texts, pose questions and make comments in the margins of the textbooks. Make sure to write all of the following:

**a Question**: Write a discussion question based on any one of the readings assigned. As you read assigned materials, note where questions come to mind about the ideas, timeline, methods or conclusions. This can be a simple, "What is X the author is talking about" or a thoughtful question that invites analysis, synthesis, or evaluation of the material, or makes connections between the readings/ previous discussion.

**a Quotation**: Identify a quotation from the reading material. Find something that is especially pertinent –in your opinion– to the main points of the readings. Your selection should be neither too short \(1 line\) nor too long \(10-12 lines\). Provide a proper citation.

**a Talking Point**: Develop a talking point – an issue or idea developed from the reading that is of interest to you. Let us “see inside your head” as you think about, accept, reject, or otherwise engage the reading material. You do not need to answer your question \(no. 1\) here, but you should discuss why you think it is an important one to consider.

**an Answer**: As your reading the textbook and reader on Perusall, read through other students' questions and try to answer one.
