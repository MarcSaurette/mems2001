# Anatomy of an Academic Article

In this exercise, we will jointly annotate an academic article.

Since our theme this week is "Where is the Middle Ages", our article attempts to grapple with the idea of whether we can see the Middle Ages as a global phenomenon - i.e. not limited only to what we now consider Europe. This article is written for specialists and so might take some time to make sense of, even if its purpose is relatively straightforward.

## Our text <a id="our-text"></a>

Catherine Holmes, Naomi Standen, "Introduction: Towards a Global Middle Ages", _Past & Present_, Volume 238, Issue suppl\_13, November 2018, Pages 1–44, [https://doi.org/10.1093/pastj/gty030](https://doi.org/10.1093/pastj/gty030)​

This text is available on Perusall. There are already a number of comments and questions to guide you through the annotation.

Before you get started, I urge you to read the next two pages, where I lay out the academic research/ writing process, so that you can understand a bit how a journal article comes to be. And then I will provide a schematic of how journal articles are organized – highlighting the most efficient ways for you to read secondary sources.
