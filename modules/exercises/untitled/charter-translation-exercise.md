# Charter Translation Exercise

Translations are attempts to make old or foreign texts intelligible to their audiences. The words, phrasings, and meanings of a translation are never perfect, but always approximations. New \(i.e. more recent\) translations are necessary to make texts speak to new audiences who might be put off or not understand antiquated terminology of an old translation. New translations are also necessary because new research can show that the original intent was misunderstood by previous translators.

For this exercise, I want us to translate the Cluniac foundation charter into a form that makes sense to you. We're going to make a new translation of Ernest F. Henderson's English translation from more than 130 years ago. 

We'll jointly create a new translation \(translating nineteenth-century English to more contemporary sounding English\) in this google sheet:
