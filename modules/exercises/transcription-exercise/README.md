# Transcription Exercise

### Reading the _King of Tars_ - from manuscript to online edition

{% hint style="info" %}
This week we will read the Middle English poem, _The_ _King of Tars,_ from two different manuscripts. We will transcribe them [in a group google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jgdChq68ahqAHc3bNBfd9O3LyZOn-HsBWJyfwyq9SGs/edit?usp=sharing). We will translate the first few lines together as a class, and then I will divide you up into groups to try to tackle a few lines on your own. 

Some letters you might need to use \( I would suggest you copy and paste from here or teach yourself [medieval unicode](untitled.md)\) :

* Ȝ - Capital Yogh
* ȝ - lowercase yogh
* ð - lowercase Eth
* Ð - uppercase Eth
* Þ - uppercase Thorn
* þ - lowercase Thorn
* ꝥ - Thorn with slash
{% endhint %}



For reference, you can compare the text of the manuscript with the text of various online editions \(or digitized printed editions\) listed below. The best starting place for students is the following, which has a glossary for the most unfamiliar terminology: 

John Chandler, ed. _The King of Tars_, TEAMS texts \(Kalamazoo, Medieval Institute Publications, 2015\). http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/publication/chandler-the-king-of-tars

* [Introduction](http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/chandler-the-king-of-tars-introduction) & the [Middle English text](http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/chandler-the-king-of-tars).
* As Chandler notes in the introduction, “_The King of Tars_ has been edited seven times before the current work”.

You can also compare Chandler’s edition to another online _diplomatic_ \(i.e. single manuscript\) [edition of the Auchinleck manuscript](https://auchinleck.nls.uk/mss/tars.html). They lay out their editorial policy [here](https://auchinleck.nls.uk/editorial/editorial.html). If you want, you can download [an Auchinleck font](https://auchinleck.nls.uk/editorial/popup/font_pop.html) and install it \(but it didn't work on my Mac\). 

If you need a dictionary to understand the text \(or guess at what words are\) there is an online Middle English dictionary consultable here: [https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary)

The reason the Bodleian is not presenting the manuscript online is because it has already been [commercially digitized](https://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?10185222&uuid=27b4b110-900b-42e9-b5f6-732e82d6aeef) \(and is not open access\).
