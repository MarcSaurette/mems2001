# Detailed Schedule

### I. How do we think about the Medieval & Early Modern Past?

#### Class 1. Introduction. 

In this class we will meet each other \(virtually\), I will explain the nature of the course and the classwork, and then chat a bit about everyone's background to the course. 

I'll ask you to introduce yourself \(hopefully, we'll meet most everyone, if time permits\), so perhaps have a few things to say about yourself and what about the class \(or the premodern subject matter of the class\) that drew you in. Having you introduce yourselves is important for me because it lets me put a face to the name \(so have your cameras on, if you're comfortable with that\) and have a few details to distinguish you from your classmates in the early days. 

You'll write a profile of yourself for your first assignment on cuPortfolio, so you can roll over your introduction into that work. 

#### Class 2 & 3. Managing Myths of the Middle Ages. 

Class 4 & 5. 

### II. Reading about the Medieval and Early Modern Past \(Secondary Sources\)

Week 5?. Need to have library research skills class \(and break up into small groups to do some research\). 

### III. Touching the Medieval and Early Modern Past \(Primary Sources\)
