# Detailed Schedule

### I. How do we think about the Medieval & Early Modern Past?

#### Class 1- September 8th. Prologue to the Middle Ages.

In this class we will meet each other \(virtually\), I will explain the nature of the course and the classwork, and then chat a bit about everyone's background to the course. 

I'll ask you to introduce yourself \(hopefully, we'll meet most everyone, if time permits\), so perhaps have a few things to say about yourself and what about the class \(or the premodern subject matter of the class\) that drew you in. Having you introduce yourselves is important for me because it lets me put a face to the name \(so have your cameras on, if you're comfortable with that\) and have a few details to distinguish you from your classmates in the early days. 

You'll write a profile of yourself for your first assignment on cuPortfolio, so you can roll over your introduction into that work. 

{% hint style="info" %}
No readings required in advance. Think about a few things you might want to say to introduce yourself. 

For next week, think about some examples of the Middle Ages in pop culture that you are familiar with – movies you've watched, toys or games you've played, books you've read, and just random examples of "medieval-ness" that surround us \(i.e. gothic style churches in downtown Ottawa, knights being used to sell insurance...\)
{% endhint %}

#### Class 2 & 3 -September 13th & 15th.  Myths of the Middle Ages. 

Our culture is permeated by images of the Middle Ages – this summer saw the release of the latest adaptation of the Middle English poem, _Gawain and the Green Knight_, heritage monuments in Ottawa are dominated by a retro nineteenth-century gothic style, and new books, toys and games which feature knights, castles, princesses \(and the such\) all the time. 

Our topic for these two classes is to consider both 1\) how images of the Middle Ages permeate our culture and 2\) why this is the case?. Try to think about the kinds of representations of the Middle Ages you see around you and attempt to posit why they are there. 

Halfway through class 3 \(12h15\), I will provide an introduction to the cuPortfolio platform. Before class, I encourage you all to have signed into cuPortfolio and taken a look at the [tutorial](../../syllabus/digital-tools/culearn/untitled.md).  I will troubleshoot what difficulties that I can help with. 

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Sign into cuPortfolio at least a day or two before class 3** \(September 16\), just in case you need to be added. Sometimes if you enroll late \(and sometimes even if you enrolled early\), there is a delay in getting you into the class group and so it will appear like you can't login to our class.  Let me know if this is the case and with advance warning, i can usually enroll you directly \(but won't have time to do this during class time\). 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Read the introduction and first chapter of Kaufman and Sturtevant's _The Devil's Historians._ 

Chapter one highlights key myths of the Middle Ages and seeks to correct them. Did any of the myths seem familiar or far-fetched? Did the counter-examples seem reasonable?

Perhaps another thing to think about also is how does the Middle Ages appear differently in pop culture and in academic scholarly circles?
{% endhint %}

#### Class 4 - September 20th. What are "Medievalisms"?

In today's class we will discuss the analytical category of "medievalisms", i.e. representations of the 'medieval' past. We will also spend some time thinking about periodization \(i.e. why do we divide the past into chunks of time?\). 

An important category of modern historical thinking is to reflect on how nostalgia, commemoration and use of the past is used in contemporary society. Reflecting on your own sense of history \(e.g. your family history, your connection to the Middle Ages, your idea of how you fit in Canadian history, what you think about statues of historical figures\).

{% hint style="info" %}
Read and comment on Louise D'Arcens, "Introduction," _Cambridge Companion to Medievalisms_ posted on [Perusall](../../syllabus/digital-tools/perusall/). 

Take a look at the [exercise](../exercises/ottawa-medievalism.md) on the Henry Harper Monument \(Ottawa\). For half the class, you will work together in small groups to understand a particularly Ottawa example of a _medievalism._ Look at the reading material listed there as well as the questions you will be expected to answer in small groups and further discuss as a class. 
{% endhint %}

#### Class 5 - September 22nd. How is Medieval Studies a _medievalism?_

In this class, we'll think about how Medieval Studies \(how the Middle Ages is taught in university\) is a form of "found medievalism" \(to use d'Arcens' term\). That academic representations of the past are not as objective as you might think and the dangers of relying on the vagaries of what evidence survives to the present. 

After I lead a rapid whirlwind tour of the development of "Medieval Studies" from the sixteenth-century to the nineteenth, Richard Utz and Patrick Geary will be our guides  to the nineteenth and twentieth century trends in academia/ professional study of the Middle Ages. As their titles indicate, Medieval Studies has a lot to do with state-supported nationalism. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Read and comment on Richard Utz, "Academic Medievalism and Nationalism," in _Cambridge Companion to Medievalism_ on Perusall. 

Read and comment on Patrick Geary, "A Poisoned Landscape: Ethnicity and Nationalism in the Nineteenth Century,” in _The Myth of Nations: The Medieval Origins of Europe_ on Perusall. 
{% endhint %}

### II. Reading about the Medieval and Early Modern Past \(Secondary Sources\)

#### Class 6 & 7 - September 27th & 29th. Contemporary relevence of Medieval Studies

Being able to distinguish the past from historical longing or imaginative nostalgia, is not only a key part of medieval studies, but is also a fundamental necessity of modern citizenship. Our goal is to engage in a bit of meta-thinking about how studying history \(in our case, medieval history\) has a purpose and how critical thinking arises from the study of the past. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Class 6**. Read and comment on Marcus Bull's _Thinking Medieval,_ chapter 4 \(on relevance\) on Perusall. 

**Class 7**. Read and comment on Kaufmann and Sturtevant's _The Devil's Historians_ chapter on the clash of civilization. Their goal is to hightlight the utility of studying history as innoculation against facile jingoism. In your comments try to address this topic. 
{% endhint %}

#### Class. 8 - October 4th. How to read for class.

In this class, we'll tackle the practical skills of reading academic history efficiently. I will open the class speaking a bit about: 

* What is a Scholarly Source vs a Reputable One? 
* Why Must I Use a Scholarly Source?

At the same time, it will introduce us to how we can conceptualize the Middle Ages as a global phenomenon \(or at least not just a Western European one...\). 

* Before class, you should complete the [Anatomy of a Secondary Source](../exercises/untitled-1/) exercise. Your annotations need to be completed by Sunday morning, so that I can see what questions and difficulties you raise, and what you take away from the article. We will practice "reading together" via Perusall as a way to have a deeper engagement with the reading.
* We will begin class by breaking you into small groups to discuss your findings
* We will return to a class discussion to discuss key questions 

{% hint style="info" %}
Before class, complete the [Anatomy of a Secondary Source](../exercises/untitled-1/) exercise
{% endhint %}

#### Class 9 - October 6th. Library Research Skills

In this class I will lay out the different parts to an academic research project and will then demonstrate some key library research tools, including:

* how to search the university library's site and save key resources
* how to access important databases
* how to cite online sources

You will then, as groups, complete a [library scavenger hunt ](../exercises/library-research-hunt.md)to practice these skills. You might need to complete some work outside of class time.

{% hint style="info" %}
No readings for this class. 
{% endhint %}

#### --- No Class 10. Thanksgiving ---------

#### Class 11 - October 13th. When and Where is the Middle Ages?

In this class, we will return to the class 8 reading, supplemented by additional material on the periodization of the Middle Ages. Our goal is to consider how historical eras \(and their geographic limits\) are in some ways manufactured after the fact and to some extent determined by historical factors. I want students to arrive at a sense of what factors make something medieval \(which is not dependent on the myths or tropes discussed previously\).  

{% hint style="info" %}
Read and comment on "Remembering the Middle Ages"... on Perusall. 
{% endhint %}

#### Class 12 & 13 - October 18th & 20th - Small Group Work .

For this week, you will be meeting and working together in groups pre-assigned by the professor to prepare your presentation on your research topic. No assigned readings.

{% hint style="danger" %}
October 25th and October 27 = Fall Reading Week. No classes. 
{% endhint %}

#### Class 14 & 15. November 1st & 3rd - Presentations. 

This week students will be making short presentations on their research topic. No assigned readings. 

### III. Touching the Medieval and Early Modern Past \(Primary Sources\)

#### Class 16. November 8th - Understanding Evidence

This week we will begin to think about how to use primary sources for medieval history. Marcus Bull will be the starting point for our conversation about what consititutes "evidence" of the Middle Ages, how it survives and what we can conclude from it. We will then address the practical questions of understanding how one particular document survived to the present - the foundation Charter of Cluny. 

Students should read and annotate the Foundation Charter of Cluny posted on Perusall, and in the last half of class we will work together to "translate" the nineteenth-century English into some more modern seeming. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Read and annotate Marcus Bull, "Evidence for Medieval History", in _Thinking Medieval_ on Perusall. 

Read and Complete [Anatomy of a Primary Source](../exercises/untitled/), including annotating the primary source, the Cluniac Foundation Charter, on Perusall. 
{% endhint %}

#### Class 17. November 10th. Veracity and Authenticity

In this class, we will be discussing the idea of historical authenticity, by reading prefaces to different historical works. One is modern \(from a work of fiction\), others are medieval \(and while self-proclaimed truthful, are largely fictional\). You will also read an article introducing you formally to using "critical" editions \(i.e. what they are, what kind of information they contain and how they can be used\). 

Your goal in reading will be to reflect on how scholarly tools \(such as critical editions\) contain valuable information that might not be apparent at first, and to consider how things that look scholarly \(and truthful\) might not. Our goal is to have you practice reading critically.

{% hint style="info" %}
Read and annotate Knibbs' article on "How to use Modern Critical Editions of Medieval Texts" to understand better what "editions" are \(when used by medievalists\). We will have talked a bit about editions in the previous class, so this should cement your understanding of this scholarly tool. 

Read and annotate the preface of Umberto Eco's _Name of the Rose_

Read and annotate the various prefaces to Geoffrey of Monmouth's _History of the Kings of Britain_ 
{% endhint %}

#### Class 18. November 15th - Introduction to Handwritten Documents

In this class, we will introduce students to the medieval folios and manuscipts in Carleton's collections. We will meet with Lloyd Keane from the Archives and Research Collection to discuss the collection, how to visit it and what an archive/repository/research collection is. 

Our goal is to introduce you to seeing medieval texts as material things that contain loads of information independent of the content on the page \(in essence you'll get a brief introduction to palaegraphy and codicology\). 

{% hint style="info" %}
Take a look at [a google folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NxCyjwV-E9DuIWZRnMHlFUuvimBfR2mM?usp=sharing) with images of the medieval material in our collections. 

Look through [a digitized version of the Carleton Antiphonary](https://carleton-antiphonary.herokuapp.com), a MA project of a former Carleton student, Kate Brasseur.

{% endhint %}

#### Class 19-20. November 17th & 22nd. Transcribing the King of Tars

We will spend two classes trying to read and compare two different manuscripts of the the Middle English Romance, _The King of Tars._ 

{% hint style="info" %}
In advance, read the [introduction](https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/chandler-the-king-of-tars-introduction) to the TEAMS online edition of the _King of Tars_

During class time, we will work on a [transcription exercise](../exercises/transcription-exercise/), which may take some additional time outside of class. 

On the 22nd, we will discuss lines 550-798 – the birth of the child of the "Saracen" Sultan of Damascus and the Christian daughter of the King of Tars.
