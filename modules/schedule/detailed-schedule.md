# Detailed Schedule

### I. How do we think about the Medieval & Early Modern Past?

#### Class 1. Prologue to the Middle Ages. 

In this class we will meet each other \(virtually\), I will explain the nature of the course and the classwork, and then chat a bit about everyone's background to the course. 

I'll ask you to introduce yourself \(hopefully, we'll meet most everyone, if time permits\), so perhaps have a few things to say about yourself and what about the class \(or the premodern subject matter of the class\) that drew you in. Having you introduce yourselves is important for me because it lets me put a face to the name \(so have your cameras on, if you're comfortable with that\) and have a few details to distinguish you from your classmates in the early days. 

You'll write a profile of yourself for your first assignment on cuPortfolio, so you can roll over your introduction into that work.

No readings required in advance.

For next week, think about some examples of the Middle Ages in pop culture that you are familiar with – movies you've watched, toys or games you've played, books you've read, and just random examples of "medieval-ness" that surround us \(i.e. gothic style churches in downtown Ottawa, knights being used to sell insurance...\)

#### Class 2 & 3. Myths of the Middle Ages. 

Our culture is permeated by images of the Middle Ages – this summer saw the release of the latest adaptation of the Middle English poem, _Gawain and the Green Knight_, heritage monuments in Ottawa are dominated by a retro nineteenth-century gothic style, and new books, toys and games which feature knights, castles, princesses \(and the such\) all the time. 

Our topic for these two classes is to consider both 1\) how images of the Middle Ages permeate our culture and 2\) why this is the case?. Try to think about the kinds of representations of the Middle Ages you see around you and attempt to posit why they are there.

Read the introduction and first chapter of Kaufman and Sturtevant's _The Devil's Historians._ 

Chapter one highlights key myths of the Middle Ages and seeks to correct them. Did any of the myths seem familiar or far-fetched? Did the counter-examples seem reasonable?

Perhaps another thing to think about also is how does the Middle Ages appear differently in pop culture and in academic scholarly circles?
