# Detailed Schedule

### I. How do we think about the Medieval & Early Modern Past?

#### Class 1. Introduction. 

In this class we will meet each other \(virtually\), I will explain the nature of the course and the classwork, and then chat a bit about everyone's background to the course. 

I'll ask you to introduce yourself \(hopefully, we'll meet most everyone, if time permits\), so perhaps have a few things to say about yourself and what about the class \(or the premodern subject matter of the class\) that drew you in. Having you introduce yourselves is important for me because it lets me put a face to the name \(so have your cameras on, if you're comfortable with that\) and have a few details to distinguish you from your classmates in the early days. 

You'll write a profile of yourself for your first assignment on cuPortfolio, so you can roll over your introduction into that work.

No readings required in advance.

For next week, think about some examples of the Middle Ages in pop culture that you are familiar with – movies you've watched, toys or games you've played, books you've read, and just random examples of "medieval-ness" that surround us \(i.e. gothic style churches in downtown Ottawa, knights being used to sell insurance...\)
{% endhint %}

#### Class 2 & 3. Myths of the Middle Ages. 

Our culture is permeated by images of the Middle Ages – this summer saw the release of the latest adaptation of the Middle English poem, _Gawain and the Green Knight_, heritage monuments in Ottawa are dominated by a retro nineteenth-century gothic style, and new books, toys and games which feature knights, castles, princesses \(and the such\) all the time. 

Our topic for these two classes is to consider both 1\) how images of the Middle Ages permeate our culture and 2\) why this is the case?
